\section{Introduction}

Symbolic execution has a proven track record in the software community as a
bug-finding tool~\cite{} and as an aid in formal verification~\cite{}. Recently,
researchers have explored the use of software-style symbolic execution for the
verification of hardware designs. To manage the search complexity that arises
two recent papers experimented with a recursive search strategy~\cite{}. The
soundness of the approach relies on a three-part strategy. However, whether this
strategy is in fact sufficient to guarantee soundness is never demonstrated. A
formal proof of correctness is needed.

In this paper we prove the validity of the recursive search strategy for the
symbolic execution of hardware designs. Using the Coq interactive theorem
prover, we formalize a model of symbolic execution.
