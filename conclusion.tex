\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we prove the correctness of a recursive symbolic execution strategy (with one alteration) while also demonstrating the usefulness of formal verification by finding a flaw in the strategy's requirements.
We also provide a formal framework of symbolic execution in Coq, allowing for future verification of other symbolic execution tools and strategies.
