\section{Definitions and Notation}
\subsection{Concrete Execution}
We represent a register transfer level hardware design as a tuple $\hardwaredesign =
(\registers,\inputsignals,\assignments_{\registers},\assignments_{\inputsignals},\init,\delta)$, which is defined as
follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\registers = \{r_0,r_1,\ldots,r_n\}$ is the finite set of state-holding
  registers in the design.
\item $\inputsignals = \{\inputsignal_0, \inputsignal_1, \ldots,
  \inputsignal_m\}$ is the finite set of input signals to the design.
\item $\assignments_{\registers} \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$
  is the finite set of assignments---valuations---to the state-holding registers. An assignment $\assignment \in \assignments_{\registers}$ is a bitvector that is the
  concatenation of valuations to all registers in $\registers$.
\item $\assignments_{\inputsignals} \subseteq \{0,1\}^e$ is the finite set of
  assignments---valuations---to the input signals. An assignment $\assignment
  \in \assignments_{\inputsignals}$ is a bitvector that is the concatenation of
  valuations to all input signals in $\inputsignals$.
\item $\init \in \assignments_{\registers}$ is the valuation to state-holding
  registers immediately after the hardware design's initialization sequence
  completes. $\init$ represents the initial state of the hardware
  design.
\item $\delta: \assignments_{\registers} \times
  \assignments_{\inputsignals} \rightarrow \assignments_{\registers}$ is the
  transition function, which represents execution of the hardware
  design. 
\end{itemize}

The set $\registers$ of state-holding registers in the design include both
microarchitectural and software-visible registers. They are \emph{state-holding}
in that they hold their current value up to and until getting updated at the
next clock cycle. As such, their current value can be an input to the
calculation of their next-state value.

A valuation $\assignment \in \assignments_{\registers}$ represents a concrete
state of the design. The length $d$ of the valuation bitvector is fixed for a
given design; every state is represented by a bitvector of length $d$. We do not
require, however, that all registers $r_i, r_j \in \registers$ have the same bit
length. the size of the state space of the design is determined by $d$:
$|\hardwaredesign| = 2^d$.

The initial state of the design, $\init$, is sometimes called the reset state and is the
valuation of the state-holding registers immediately after the power-on
cycle completes.

The transition function, $\delta$, is left-total: for every
$\assignment_{\registers} \in \assignments_{\registers}$ and every
$\assignment_{\inputsignals} \in \assignments_{\inputsignals}$, $\delta$ is
defined.

We do not model the output of the
module explicitly; it is the identity function taken over a subset of the
state-holding registers in the design.

%% \cks{scrap: to a
%%   bitvector of length $d$. The bitvector represents the concatenation of valuations to registers $r_0,
%%   r_1, \ldots, r_n$ and inputs signals $\inputsignal_0, \inputsignal_1, \ldots,
%%   \inputsignal_m$. The length of the bitvector, $d$, can be thought of in some
%%   sense as the length or dimension of hte design.   We use $\assignment_{\registers}$ or $\assignment_{\inputsignals}$ to refer to the
%%   slice of an assignment that pertains to the valuation of just the state
%%   holding registers or just the input signals, respectively.
%%  }
%%   $\inputsignals$. It is useful to treat each $\assignment \in \assignments$ as
%%   a tuple $(\assignment_{\registers},\assignment_{\inputsignals})$ in which
%%   $\assignment_{\registers} = \assignment[0:c]$ is the bitvector valuation to
%%   only the state-holding registers and $\assignment_{\inputsignals} =
%%   \assignment[c:d]$ is the bitvector valuation to only the input
%%   signals.\footnote{In this slice notation the first index is inclusive
%%     and the second index is exclusive.} Let $\assignments_{\registers}$ be the
%%   set of all $\assignment_{\registers}$ and $\assignments_{\inputsignals}$ be
%%   the set of all $\assignment_{\inputsignals}$.

%% A state $\concstate \in \concstates$ of the module is a concrete valuation to all
%% registers in the design: $r_0 = i, r_1 = j, \ldots, r_m = k$, where $r_0, r_1,
%% r_m$ represent the stateful registers and $i, j, k
%% \in \{0,1\}^*$. 
%% The domain of the module is the set of binary strings of length $n$, which
%% represents the concatenation of multiple input parameters to the module.
%% The transition function takes the module from one state to the next state. It
%% represents the execution of a single clock-cycle in hardware. 

\subsection{Symbolic Execution}
The result of symbolic execution is a rooted, binary tree $\tree = (N, E, l)$, where
$N$ is the set of nodes of the tree, $E$ is the set of directed edges connecting
two nodes, and $l \in N$ is a particular leaf node of interest in the tree. This
leaf node represents a desired next-state of the module being symbolically
explored, and in the recursive strategy, it is this leaf node that is joined to
the root node of a subsequent tree in the search.

Each node $n \in N$ of the tree is a tuple $n = (\symstate, \pathcondition)$, where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\symstate$ is a (partially) symbolic state of the module and
\item $\pathcondition$ is the current path condition.
\end{itemize}

A symbolic state assigns a symbolic expression, \symexpression, to every register in the design: $r_0 =
\symexpression_0, r_1 = \sigma_1, \ldots, r_m = \sigma_m$. A symbolic expression
\symexpression{} contains at least one symbol and may contain zero or more concrete
literals, arithmetic operators, and logical operators. Examples of
symbolic expressions include `$\alpha$' and `$\alpha + 1$,' where
$\alpha$ is a symbol used by the symbolic execution engine.

A path condition, \pathcondition, is a conjunction of propositions involving
symbolic expressions. For example `$\pathcondition = \alpha + 1 \ge 0 \wedge \alpha < 1$' is a
possible path condition.

We define \symexecution() for a particular hardware module as an abstract method
that takes as input an initial symbolic
state $\symstate$, an initial path condition $\pathcondition_0 = \texttrue$, and a
set of symbolic inputs, and 
returns a tree of explored paths. In the recursive strategy, \symexecution{} is
always called with an initial
symbolic state that is fully symbolic: $r_0 = \alpha, r_1 = \beta, \ldots, r_m = \omega$.

The alphabet of symbols that can appear in a path condition is the union of the
alphabet of symbols used to define a symbolic state and the alphabet of symbols
used as input values by \symexecution{}: $\Sigma_{\pathcondition} = \Sigma_{\symstate} \cup \Sigma_i$.


%% We model a symbolic execution engine as a tuple $\symbolicexecutionengine =
%% (\symstates, \rootsymstate, \symalphabet, \pathconditions, \symexecution,  
%% \trees)$, where
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item $\symstates$ is the set of (partially) symbolic states : $\{(\variable_0,\symvalue), (\variable_1,\symvalue), \ldots, (\variable_n,\symvalue)\}$
%% \item $\rootsymstate \in \symstates$
%% \item $\symexecution: \{\symstates,\pathcondition\}
%%   \times \{\syminputs\} \rightarrow \trees$
%% \item $\pathconditions$
%% \item $\symalphabet$ The alphabet of symbols that appear in symbolic expressions
%%   and symbolic assignments.
%% \item $\trees$ The set of trees $\tree = \{E,\nodes\}$. Each tree is a binary tree of nodes.
%% \end{itemize}


%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item $\pathcondition \in \pathconditions$ is the path condition of a particular node of a tree.
%% \item $\pathconditions \subseteq \mathrm{symexpressions}$ Path condition is a subtype of
%%   symexpressions. The set of all path conditions is a subset of the set of all
%%   symexpressions.
%% \item $\nodes: \{\symstate,\pathcondition\}$, where $\symstate \in \symstates$
%%   and $\pathcondition \in \pathconditions$.
%% \item $\syminputs: <(\inputvariable_0, \symexpression), (\inputvariable_1,
%%   \symexpression), \ldots, (\inputvariable_m, \symexpression)>$
%% \end{itemize}



%% We model the program to be symbolically executed
%% S = {(reg_0, symexpr_0), (reg_1, symexpr_1), ..., (reg_n, symexpr_n)} (edited)
%% symInp = {(inp_0, symexpr_0), (inp_1, symexpr_1), ..., (inp_k, symexpr_k)} (edited)
%% Inp = {(inp_0, inpval_0), (inp_1, inpval_1), ..., (inp_k, inpval_k)} (edited)
%% C = {(reg_0, concval_0), (reg_1, concval_1), ..., (reg_n, concval_n)}

\subsection{Properties of Symbolic Execution}
King formalized the use of symbolic execution~\cite{king1976symbolic} and
described three fundamental
properties provided by a symbolic execution engine. We name and summarize the properties
and for each, give our formal expression of the property.
\setcounter{property}{0}
\renewcommand{\theproperty}{K.\arabic{property}}
\begin{property}[Sound Paths]
  \label{prop:kingsound}
  The path condition $\pathcondition$ never becomes unsatisfiable. For each
  leaf node $l$ of a symbolic execution tree, there exists, for the path condition
  associated with $l$, at
  least one satisfying concrete valuation to the symbols of the path
  condition; that is, one mapping of symbols to concrete values that
  would make the path condition evaluate to \texttrue. If this mapping of satisfying concrete values were
  applied to the initial symbolic state and symbolic inputs, the resulting
  concrete execution would follow the same path through the program as was taken
  by the symbolic execution engine to arrive at the leaf node $l$. In other
  words, all paths taken by the symbolic execution engine correspond to feasible
  paths through the program.
  
  We express this in the following way: 
  
%%   \begin{align*}
%%   \forall a = \mathtt{maptoalph}(\mathrm{alphabet}), & n =
%% \mathtt{intree}(\symexecution(\symstate,\syminput)), \\
%%  & \mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{plugin}(n.\pathcondition,a) = \texttrue.
%%   \end{align*}

  \begin{align*}
    \forall m = \mathtt{map(\cdot)},~\symstate \in \symstates,~\alpha \in \Sigma_i,~& n \in \tree = \symexecution(\symstate,\pathcondition_0,\alpha), \\
    & \mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{applymap}(n.\pathcondition,m)) = \texttrue.
  \end{align*}
  Where $\mathtt{map(\cdot)}$ is the set of all functions that map from the set
  of symbols $\Sigma$ to the set of concrete values, \symstates{} is the set of all
  possible symbolic states, $\Sigma_i$ is the set of symbolic input values, and $n$ is a node in the tree $t$ produced by a call
  to \symexecution.
\end{property}


\begin{property}[Unique Paths]
  \label{prop:kingunique}
The path condition $\pathcondition_1$ and $\pathcondition_2$ associated with any two paths of the
tree are mutually unsatisfiable. In other words, there exists no concrete
valuation that could drive execution down two distinct paths of the symbolic
execution tree.

We express this the following way: 

\begin{align*}
\forall m = \mathtt{map(\cdot)},~\symstate \in \symstates,~\alpha \in
\Sigma_i,~& n_1,~ n_2 \in \tree =
\symexecution(\symstate,\pathcondition_0,\alpha), \\
& n_1 \neq n_2 \\
&  \wedge
(\mathtt{ischildof}(n_1, n_2) \vee  \mathtt{ischildof}(n_2, n_1))= \textfalse \\
&\rightarrow \mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{applymap}(n_1.\pathcondition \wedge n_2.\pathcondition,m)) = \textfalse.
\end{align*}

%% \begin{align*}
%% \forall a = \mathtt{maptoalph}(\mathrm{alphabet}), &  n_1 n_2 =
%% \mathtt{intree}(\symexecution(\symstate,\syminput)) \\
%% & \wedge
%% n_1 \neq n_2 \\
%% &  \wedge
%% (\mathtt{ischildof}(n_1, n_2) \vee  \mathtt{ischildof}(n_2, n_1))= \textfalse \\
%% &\rightarrow \mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{plugin}(l.\pathcondition,a) = \textfalse
%% \end{align*}
\end{property}

\begin{property}[Commutativity]
  \label{prop:kingcommutativity}
  The actions of symbolically executing a program and instantiating symbols with
  concrete values ($\mathtt{applymap(\cdot)}$ in our model) are commutative. If a
  mapping is first chosen and then the program is executed concretely, the end
  state will be the same as if the program is executed symbolically and then,
  for a particular leaf, a mapping is chosen such that the path constraint of
  that leaf is satisfied.

  %% We define some functions.
  %% \begin{itemize}
  %% \item maptoalph: $\{\symalphabet\} \rightarrow \{\concvalue\}$
  %% \item plugin: $\{\symexpression\} \times \{\concvalue\} \rightarrow
  %%   \{\concexpression\}$
  %% \item simplify: $\{\concexpression\} \rightarrow \{\concvalue\}$
  %% \end{itemize}




\begin{align*}
\forall m = \mathtt{map(\cdot)},~\symstate \in \symstates,~\alpha \in \Sigma_i,~& l \in \tree = \symexecution(\symstate,\pathcondition_0,\alpha) \wedge
\mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{applymap}(l.\pathcondition,m)) = \texttrue \\
&\rightarrow \mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{applymap}(l.\symstate,m)) = \\
&\qquad\concexecution(\mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{applymap}(\symstate,m)),\mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{applymap}(\syminput,m))).
\end{align*}
Where $l$ is a leaf node of the tree returned by \symexecution.

%% \begin{align*}
%% \forall a = \mathtt{maptoalph}(\mathrm{alphabet}), & l =
%% \mathtt{isleaf}(\symexecution(\symstate,\syminput)) \wedge
%% \mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{plugin}(l.\pathcondition,a) = \texttrue \\
%% &\rightarrow \mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{plugin}(l.\symstate,a)) = \\
%% &\qquad\concexecution(\mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{plugin}(\symstate)),\mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{plugin}(\syminput)))
%% \end{align*}

\end{property}



\subsection{Recursive Strategy Requirements}
We express the three original requirements of the recursive strategy as
laid out by Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang2018recursive}. 
%The following requirements, when placed on our system, should be enough to prove that the strategy works as expected:
We start by formally defining two instantiation operations that are only informally described
by Zhang et al. but that are used by the strategy requirements.

\subsubsection{Instantiation Operations} 

The root node of a symbolic execution tree $t$ contains a symbolic state
  ($\mathtt{getroot}(t).\symstate$), which can be viewed as a representation of
  a set of possible concrete states. If \symstate{} is fully symbolic, meaning
  that all registers in the design are assigned symbolic expressions ($r_0 =
  \sigma_0, r_1 = \sigma_1, \ldots$), then it represents the set of all
  possible concrete states $\concstates$. From the set of all possible concrete
  states, all possible next states are reachable, and these are represented by
  the leaves of the symbolic execution tree. The symbolic state of each leaf node of the tree
  represents a subset of $\concstates$.

  The effect of the
operations ($\mathtt{concretize\_root}$ and $\mathtt{concretize\_leaf}$) is to take a node (root or leaf) of a symbolic execution tree and
find the set of concrete states represented by the symbolic state of that
node. 
%% Our two instantiation operations are defined in the following way: 
%% $$\mathtt{concretize\_root} : \{ \tree \} \rightarrow \{\concstates\}$$

%% $$\mathtt{concretize\_leaf} : \{ \tree \} \rightarrow \{\concstates\}$$

%% They are bound by the following requirements:

\begin{mydefinition}[\emph{concretize\_root}]
  \label{def:concroot}
  
  For any given leaf node of the
  tree, the set of concrete states represented by that node is reachable, with a
  given input, from a subset of the concrete states represented by the root
  node. This instantiation operation finds that subset of concrete states
  for the particular leaf node of interest of a tree. The operation takes as
  input a tree (remember that a tree is
  the tuple $t = (N, E, l)$, where $l$ is a particular leaf node of interest of
  the tree) and returns
  a set of concrete states. We define it formally here.

  \begin{align*}
\forall \tree \in \trees,~ \concstate \in \concstates,~& \concstate \in
\mathtt{concretize\_root}(t) \leftrightarrow \\
&\exists r,n \in t,~ m = \mathtt{map(\cdot)} \mathrm{~such~that}\\
&r = \mathtt{getroot}(t), n = t.l,
\mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{applymap} (n.\pathcondition, m)) = \texttrue \\
&\mathrm{and~}  c = \mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{applymap}(r.\symstate, m)),
    \end{align*}
\end{mydefinition}
where \trees{} is the set of all possible symbolic execution trees.

The definition says that any mapping ($\mathtt{map(\cdot)}$) from symbolic to concrete values that makes
the path condition of the leaf node evaluate to \texttrue{} will, when applied to
the symbolic state of the root node, produce a concrete state in the set returned
by $\mathtt{concretize\_root}$.

\begin{mydefinition}[\emph{concretize\_leaf}]
  \label{def:concleaf}

  This instantiation operation finds the set of concrete states represented by
  the particular leaf node of interest of a tree.
  \begin{align*}
\forall \tree \in \trees,~ \concstate \in \concstates,~& \concstate \in
\mathtt{concretize\_leaf}(t) \leftrightarrow \\
&\exists n \in t,~ m = \mathtt{map(\cdot)} \mathrm{~such~that}\\
&n = t.l,
\mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{applymap} (n.\pathcondition, m)) = \texttrue \\
&\mathrm{and~}  c = \mathtt{simplify}(\mathtt{applymap}(n.\symstate, m)),
    \end{align*}
\end{mydefinition}
where \trees{} is the set of all possible symbolic execution trees.

The definition says that any mapping ($\mathtt{map(\cdot)}$) from symbolic to concrete values that makes
the path condition of the leaf node evaluate to \texttrue{} will, when applied to
the symbolic state of that same leaf node, produce a concrete state in the set returned
by $\mathtt{concretize\_leaf}$.

\subsubsection{Three Original Requirements} The goal of the symbolic execution
of a hardware design is to find a sequence of $n$ inputs that will take the hardware
module from an initial reset state to an error state in $n$ clock cycles. The
gist of the recursive search strategy is to search backward from the error
state as follows. First use symbolic execution to find a state $s_i$ that has the error
state as one of its possible next-state transitions. Then use symbolic execution
to find a state $s_{i-1}$ that has $s_i$ has one of its possible next-state
transitions. This search continues until one of the found $s_i$'s is a reset
state. Each application of symbolic execution produces a tree with a particular
leaf node of interest---the desired next-state $s_i$. This sequence of trees ($\mathit{tree\_list}$)
must satisfy these three requirements as laid out by Zhang et al.
\setcounter{property}{0}
\renewcommand{\theproperty}{Z.\arabic{property}}
\begin{property}[Start in initial state]
  \label{prop:startinit} The leaf node of interest in the first tree in the
  sequence must be reachable from the initial, reset state.
  \begin{align*}
    \concstate_0 \in \mathtt{concretize\_root}(\mathit{tree\_list}[0]).
  \end{align*}
\end{property}

\begin{property}[End in error state]
  \label{prop:enderror} The leaf node of interest in the last tree in the
  sequence must include, in the set of concrete states it represents, one of the
  desired error states. 
  \begin{align*}
    \mathtt{concretize\_leaf}(\mathit{tree\_list}[n]) \cap \mathit{ER} \neq
    \emptyset,
  \end{align*}
\end{property}
where $\mathit{ER}$ represents the set of desired error states.

\begin{property}[Stitch trees together]
  \label{prop:stitch}
  Consecutive trees in the sequence must form a continuous path of
  execution. That is, the leaf node of one tree must represent a subset of the
  states represented by the root node of the subsequent tree in the sequence.
  \begin{align*}
    &\forall i, 0 \le i < n,\\
    &\quad\mathtt{concretize\_leaf}(\mathit{tree\_list}[i]) \subseteq
\mathtt{concretize\_root}\mathit{tree\_list}[i+1].
\end{align*}

\end{property}

\subsubsection{Modified Requirement}
We find the above properties are not sufficient to prove correctness of the
recursive strategy. We strengthen Property~\ref{prop:enderror} by replacing it with the following.

\setcounter{property}{1}
\renewcommand{\theproperty}{Z.\arabic{property}'} 
\begin{property}[Property~\ref{prop:enderror} correction]
  The leaf node of interest in the last tree in the
  sequence must represent a subset of the desired error states. The leaf node
  can not represent any concrete state that is not an error state.
  \label{prop:correctedz2}
  \begin{align*}
    \mathtt{concretize\_leaf}(\mathit{tree\_list}[n]) \subseteq \mathit{ER}.
  \end{align*}

 \end{property}
